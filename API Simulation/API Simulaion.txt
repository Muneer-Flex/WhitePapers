API Simulation
	
	-- Current problem without API Simulation
	
		As we extensively work on in Microservices which helps developers to develop & deploy services independently.. but still there is a tight
		dependency b/w front end & the backend API's and backend API's with other third party API'service .. So now API's are dependent on each other ..
		
		For instance, let consider a situation where backend developers build an API which collects some data from front end & post it to the third party API's... 
		Now these API's are dependent on third party API's & only when those API's are completed & deployed .. we shall able to test the flow .. So now both the front & 
		back end developer's are blocked..
		
		-- brief about API Simulation
		
		This can be avoided by mocking the third party API's.. When the request & response structure is confirmed by the third party API's, App can tested end to end
		using API Simulation techniques..
		
		Not only when there is a dependency, also in a situation where the third party API's have some outages or when they have restrictions in number of free
		requests per month, API Simulation becomes very useful!
			
	-- Many products available in Market - chosed API Simulator & WireMock .. both are free & Open source!
	
	-- API Simulator
		-- Demo
			-- Download format & How to start the Mock Server & show the logs

	-- Comparison b/w API Simulator & WireMock
	-- Disadvantages -- needs to be restarted when there is a change in the Mock/ new service is included
