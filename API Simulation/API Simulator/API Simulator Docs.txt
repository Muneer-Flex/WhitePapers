		This will boot up the API Simulator [opens up another command prompt] & could see the logs in 
		
			{downloaded location}/apisimulator-http-1.1-distro/apisimulator/apisimulator-http-1.1/examples/hello-sim
			
			We have options for default & specific Stub testing and these configured as yaml files & available in below path
				Default one,
					{downloaded location}/apisimulator-http-1.1-distro/apisimulator/apisimulator-http-1.1/examples/hello-sim/simlets/_dafault
				
				Specfic one,
					{downloaded location}/apisimulator-http-1.1-distro/apisimulator/apisimulator-http-1.1/examples/hello-sim/simlets/greetings
		
		Hit the below URL's from browser or from Postman...
		
			http://localhost:6090 --> default simlet
				--> returns Hello, World!
				
			http://localhost:6090/greetings/muneer  --> greeting simlet
				--> returns Hello, Muneer!
			
			My Example -- getting ePO version
			
			http://localhost:6090/ePO/version/1.0  --> ePO Simlet

		My Example - Payment-Simulation
		
			Created a folder payment-simulation under examples folder
			
			Inside that, created simlets folder
			
			Inside that, created folders for stub ::
				_default 		   --> contains default stub response [provides a default response (as of now configured as 404]
				
				create-payment 	   --> POST request stubbing.. created a simlet.yaml file & defined the API stubbing
										http://localhost:6090/flex/payments/createPayment  --> [Bring up the API simulator & hit from POSTMAN]
										
										Headers::
											Content-Type application/json
										
										Body::
										
											{
												"payment": {
													"id": "1234",
													"name": "Muneer",
													"category": "Electicity Bill",
													"subCategory": "TNEB",
													"Mode": "Debit Card"
												}
											}
											
				get-payment-muneer --> GET request stubbing.. created a simlet.yaml file & defined the API stubbing
										http://localhost:6090/flex/payments/details.json --> [Bring up the API simulator & hit from browser or POSTMAN]
										
				update-payment     --> PUT request stubbing.. created a simlet.yaml file & defined the API stubbing
										http://localhost:6090/flex/payments  --> [Bring up the API simulator & hit from POSTMAN]
										
										Headers::
											Content-Type application/json
										
										Body::
										
											{
												"payment": {
													"id": "1234",
													"name": "Muneer",
													"category": "Electicity Bill",
													"subCategory": "TNEB",
													"Mode": "Debit Card"
												}
											}
											
				Bring up the API Simulator ...
					cd into {downloaded location}/apisimulator-http-1.1-distro/apisimulator/apisimulator-http-1.1/bin
					
					syntax :: apisimulator start <path of simlets>
		
					Example : apisimulator start examples/payment-simulation

		To Perform multiple different API Simulation [for eg:: ePO version simulation & payment-simulation at the same time]
		
			boot up the API Simulator for ePO version & payment-simulation .. This will get failed due to Address binding issue since 
			the default port 6090 & default admin port 6191 will be used by the API which got booted first.. so need to specify different ports in the next API
			
			Syntax :: apisimulator start <path of simlets> -p <port-number> -admin_port <port-number>
			
			Example : apisimulator start examples/hello-sim -p 8080 -admin_port 8090
			
			Using my IP Address,
				http://10.203.11.225:6090/flex/payments/details.json
				
				http://10.203.11.225:8080/ePO/version/1.0
		
		End Points:
		
			http://localhost:6090/flex/payments/createPayment

			http://localhost:6090/flex/payments/details.json

			http://localhost:6090/flex/payments

			http://localhost:8080/ePO/version/1.0
